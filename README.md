# Quality Content

A collection of silly meme applications born mostly from inside jokes of ours.

üìö These projects are not being actively worked on since this is an archive.

> [!WARNING]
> Beware that some of the apps contain strong flashing lights which may cause epileptic seizures, very loud audio, and
> code that changes some system settings like desktop wallpaper or display settings, blocks user control or shuts down
> the computer, all for joke purposes.

Don't worry, nothing here contains harmful code; everything is verified and tested by multiple people. Windows
SmartScreen and some antivirus software might block the apps, because they're not signed. Most apps don't require
internet connection at all, except some which download images or other multimedia. Just turn your volume down when
necessary to avoid damaging your hearing and headphones from loud sounds.

üîç Feel free to analyze the code or run it in a virtual machine if you don't trust it. Just note the effects won't be as
immersive and performance might suffer.

Here's a full list:

Since these projects were made while learning the tools and languages, there is a lot of bad, messy code. Some small
changes have been made since to ensure the apps run better on modern operating system versions, such as updated
dependencies, libraries, and asset loading system. Everything else is left as is.

Unfortunately, the source code for few of the projects has been lost long ago. We will try to restore them when we can.
